# UnityC-Scripts From 2 Built Games and 2 Part Games
Here are some scripts I built. I tried to find the scripts that would be of use to ones. Learned syntax or just exploring new ideas. 

I built two full games (coded with C# using Unity). Both these game have been published. 
During my learning of C# and Unity I modded a game, and added quest functionality to it. 
My last game (that was never finished) I used some advanced C# syntax. 

Some of these scripts may be of use, and some of these my just be over done syntax. Hopefull you will find it useful.
